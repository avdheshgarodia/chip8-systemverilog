===================

A chip 8 interpreter written in system verilog.
This project was done as a final project for ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory in FALL of 2014. This project was implemented on an Altera FPGA. I was able to run the use the interpreter to run chip 8 programs such as tetris and pong.
